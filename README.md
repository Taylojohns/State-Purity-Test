# State-Purity-Test
The State Purity Test is a fun, modern twist inspired by the well-known Rice Purity Test. This project was originally created using Create React App as a way to practice React, so please don’t take it too seriously—it’s meant for entertainment and learning purposes. All of the original questions came directly from the Rice Purity Test, but I wanted to experiment with how results could be interpreted differently.

In the traditional Rice Purity Test, every “yes” answer would simply subtract from a total of 100. That meant a score of 100 represented complete purity, while a score of 0 meant absolute corruption. The problem with that system is that it treats all actions the same—so something like holding hands is considered just as “impure” as trying hard drugs. That didn’t quite sit right, so the State Purity Test takes a different approach by assigning weights to each action.

Here’s how it works: lighter, everyday experiences are considered Minor Acts and count less against your purity score, while more serious or extreme actions are given a higher weight. Specifically, the test is divided into categories—20 minor acts (weight of 1), 30 immoral acts (weight of 2), 20 raunchy acts (weight of 3), 20 scandalous acts (weight of 4), and 10 unspeakable acts (weight of 5). While this method is still subjective, it provides a clearer picture when comparing scores with others.

For example, Minor Acts cover the more innocent experiences—like holding hands, going on dates, sharing a first kiss, sneaking alcohol, or even skinny-dipping with friends. Immoral Acts step things up a bit, including longer kissing sessions, experimenting with intimacy, smoking, trying marijuana, or even having run-ins with school discipline. The Raunchy Acts go further—things like streaking, casual hookups, or experimenting with drugs stronger than marijuana. Then there are the Scandalous Acts, which include riskier behaviors such as public sex, being arrested, joining the infamous “mile-high club,” or being filmed during intimacy. Finally, the Unspeakable Acts cross into the extreme—cheating, committing crimes, experimenting with hard drugs, or engaging in taboo encounters.

The idea isn’t to shame anyone but rather to create a more nuanced version of the purity test that reflects different levels of experiences. At the end of the day, it’s all in good fun—a way to laugh, compare results with friends, and maybe reflect a little on the experiences that shape us.
